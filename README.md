# Digital Image Processing Practices

Welcome to the **Digital Image Processing Practices** repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing and experimenting with concepts from your Digital Image Processing (DIP) class. Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on exercises, projects, and examples to enhance your understanding of image processing techniques.

## Introduction

Digital Image Processing is a fascinating field that plays a crucial role in various applications, from enhancing photos to medical image analysis and computer vision. This repository serves as a practical companion to your DIP class, providing you with the opportunity to apply what you've learned in a real-world context.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folder structure:

- [Lab_01](./Lab_01): Lab 01 exercises and projects.
- [Lab_02](./Lab_02): Lab 02 assignments and tasks.
- [Lab_03](./Lab_03): Lab 03 projects and experiments.
- ...

Each lab's folder contains relevant materials, including Jupyter Notebooks, image datasets, and code samples.

## Technologies Used
