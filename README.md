# Digital Image Processing Practices

Welcome to the **Digital Image Processing Practices** repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing and experimenting with concepts from your Digital Image Processing (DIP) class. Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on exercises, projects, and examples to enhance your understanding of image processing techniques.

## Introduction

Digital Image Processing is a fascinating field that plays a crucial role in various applications, from enhancing photos to medical image analysis and computer vision. This repository serves as a practical companion to your DIP class, providing you with the opportunity to apply what you've learned in a real-world context.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folder structure:

- [LAB_01](./LAB_01): Lecture 1 Exercises
- [LAB_02](./LAB_02): Lecture 2 Exercises
- [LAB_03](./LAB_03): Lecture 3 Exercises
- [LAB_04](./LAB_04): Lecture 4 Exercises
- [LAB_05](./LAB_05): Lecture 5 Exercises
- [LAB_05](./LAB_06): Lecture 6 Exercises
- [LAB_07](./LAB_07): Lecture 7 Exercises
- [LAB_08](./LAB_08): Lecture 8 Exercises
- [LAB_09](./LAB_09): Lecture 9 Exercises
- [LAB_10](./LAB_10): Lecture 10 Exercises
- [LAB_11](./LAB_11): Lecture 11 Exercises
- [LAB_12](./LAB_12): Lecture 12 Exercises
- ...

Each lab's folder contains relevant materials, including Jupyter Notebooks, image datasets, and code samples.
